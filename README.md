## Card Memory Game - Simplified Skill Test

### Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in joining! This is a simplified skill test designed to understand your approach to problem-solving and development. The tasks are categorized based on your area of expertise.

### üéØ **Objective:**

Build a small part of a card memory game based on your assigned role. This is meant to be completed within **2‚Äì3 hours** to showcase your skills.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack:**

- Frontend: React, Vite
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB (only if applicable)
- Web3: MetaMask integration (only if applicable)

### üöÄ **Setup Guide:**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YaroslavPedrovic/hiring_test.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hiring_test
    ```
3.  Set up the backend:

    ```bash
    cd ./backend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

    _The backend server requires a `.env` file located in the `/backend` directory to load necessary environment variables (like database connection strings and secrets)._

4.  Set up the frontend:
    ```bash
    # Navigate back to the root if you are inside /backend
    cd ..
    # Or directly if you are in the root: cd ./frontend
    cd ./frontend
    npm install
    # The default start script for Vite is usually 'dev', but 'start' might be configured.
    # Using 'npm run dev' is generally safer for Vite projects during development.
    npm run dev
    # If 'npm start' is specifically configured in frontend/package.json, use that:
    # npm start
    ```
5.  Visit `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite) in your browser to see the project running.
